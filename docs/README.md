# Welcome to [Am I Transgender](http://am-i-transgender.com)!

This site on it's way to becoming a multi-faceted resource for transgender, questioning and non-binary people!

Currently I am looking into updating as much as I can locally and keeping things as a surprise, releasing things as I feel they're ready. I have a Jekyll build that I'm using which should help immensly when creating things and uploading them.

I'm looking into ways to gather data on the website currently, and whether or not it's feasible to use an external database, or save it somewhere else.  
That and I'm going to need resources, lots and lots of resources.
